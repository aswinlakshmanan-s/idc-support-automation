## IDC AI-Powered Content Generation Toolkit

This repository contains automation scripts and configuration templates developed during my part-time role as an Instructional Design Consultant (IDC). These tools streamline the generation of AI-based educational content, automate video retrieval workflows, and integrate with AI avatar platforms like Elai.

## Project Overview

The project is focused on:
- Generating course content using a **configuration-driven model**
- Testing **AI avatar rendering** with Elai APIs
- Retrieving and processing **video assets** dynamically for instructional use
- Supporting **faculty productivity** by abstracting AI complexities

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `retrieve_video.py` | Script to fetch and organize educational video files for further AI processing |
| `elai_test.py` | Script to test integration with the Elai platform (for avatar/narration rendering) |
| `Configuration Driven Model.pdf` | Documentation explaining how course content is generated using YAML/JSON configuration |
| `Key Implementation Requirements.pdf` | High-level system requirements covering content generation, AI model tuning, video rendering, and review workflow |

## Features

-  **Configuration-Driven Scripting**: Generate full course outlines, lesson plans, quizzes, and narration using YAML-based configs.
-  **AI Video Narration**: Integrates with Elai to generate AI-presented course videos from text.
-  **Video Asset Retrieval**: Automates sourcing and organization of video clips.
-  **Refinement Workflow**: Editable templates allow iterative content generation based on faculty feedback.
